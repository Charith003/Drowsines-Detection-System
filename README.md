# Drowsines-Detection-System

A real-time computer vision based safety application that detects driver fatigue using facial landmark analysis. The system monitors eye movements through the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method and triggers an audio alert when prolonged eye closure is detected.

Built using Python, OpenCV, Dlib, SciPy, and Pygame, this project helps prevent accidents caused by drowsiness in drivers and workers by providing instant warnings.

### *Features*:

Real-time face and eye detection

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based fatigue monitoring

Sound alert for drowsiness detection

Works with webcam in live environment

Lightweight and fast processing


### *Working Principle*:

Webcam captures live video feed

Face detection identifies user’s face

Facial landmarks locate eye regions

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) is calculated

If EAR remains low → alarm is activated
