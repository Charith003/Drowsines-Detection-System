# Drowsines-Detection-System
This Drowsiness Detection System tracks eye movements in real time using OpenCV, Dlib, and facial landmark analysis. It improves safety in driving and work environments by detecting prolonged eye closure and triggering an alert sound to prevent fatigue-related accidents by calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).
